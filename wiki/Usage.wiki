= Examples =

Suppose you have a command that generates a datastream on stdout.<br>
`tar cf - somedir`

Suppose you want to compress it very quickly.  Suppose you are on a machine with a Quad core processor, Xeon (hyperthreaded, for 8 possible threads)<br>
`tar cf - somedir | threadzip.py -t 8 --fast > somedir.tar.tz`

Suppose you want it compressed as small as possible.  (Typically 2x to 4x longer compression time, and about 2% smaller result.  Your mileage may vary, depending on the data you're compressing.)<br>
`tar cf - somedir | threadzip.py -t 8 --best > somedir.tar.tz`

Either way, you want to extract it afterward...<br>
`cat somedir.tar.tz | threadunzip.py -t 8 | tar tf -`<br>
or<br>
`threadunzip.py -t 8 < somedir.tar.tz | tar tf -`<br>
